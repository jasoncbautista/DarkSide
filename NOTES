Investigate Limitations of Ininite Scroll

- window.scrollTo(x,y) will let us scroll the user to a specific
  part of our document
  --- BUT if the user is scrolling on their own.. it wont' work

- jqueryObj.scrollTop() gives us the amount the user has scrolled:
   $("body").scrollTop()
  - this is relative to the total height of the DOM object
